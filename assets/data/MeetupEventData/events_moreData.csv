quantifiedself,1218515828000,22,Quantified Self Inaugural Show&Tell!,http://www.meetup.com/quantifiedself/events/8526229/,<p>Come share your experiences/tools/advice about self-tracking, self-experiment, life-logging, personal data collection. Feel free to bring devices you are using, questions you have, or technical problems in need of solution.</p> <p><b>Venue Details</b></p> <p>KK* Studio is conveniently fitted out with chairs, soft drinks, white board - it is big enough, well-appointed, and comfortable. The one thing it is <i>not</i> is located near public transportation. So we are going to arrange rides from the Colma BART station (10 minutes away) for anybody who prefers a small carbon footprint. Please contact the organizer (gary@aether.com) if you'd like a ride.</p> <p>Pacifica is just south of San Francisco. If you are driving it is easy to get to from Berkeley, San Francisco, or the peninsula. <a href="http://www.kk.org/contact/map.php">Map</a></p> <p>Who are the Organizers?</p> <p><a href="http://www.kk.org/kk/">More info on Kevin Kelly</a><br/><a href="http://www.aether.com/">More info on Gary Isaac Wolf</a></p> <p><b>DRIVING DIRECTONS</b></p> <p>Kevin Kelly's house/office<br/>149 Amapola, Pacifica.<br/>Office phone is 650-355-7676<br/>Home phone is 650-355-3660.</p> <p>Your basic Google map of our little valley off of Route 1 in Pacifica<br/><a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;q=149+amapola+ave+Pacifica+ca&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;om=1"><a href="http://maps.google.co" class="linkified">http://maps.google.co</a>...</a></p> <p>However it's helpful to have a few hints once you get in the neighborhood.</p> <p>From the traffic light (the sign at the light should say "Vallemar and Reina del Mar) head straight back on Reina del Mar for about 1 mile until you hit the large trees, where the road does a jig-jag. Bear to the left side of the fork, but continue in the general direction you were going (in other words don't make a hard turn at the jig-jag). Proceed along the left side of the creek for about 6 blocks. The road will turn to the right following the creek, but you should continue straight. The road changes name to Amapola. We are the 6th or so house on the left, a redwood sided ranch with a redwood shingle tower -- the last house on the block. Park on the street.</p> <p>I work in the tower to the left as you stand on the street; enter in the back near driveway.</p> <p><b>FOR PICK UP AT COLMA BART</b></p> <p>RIDES</p> <p>Two people so far are taking BART - there will be a shuttle (i.e., my car!) from the Colma BART station to the meeting in Pacifica, which is just a few minutes drive. Pickup details below.</p> <p>PROGRAM</p> <p>We are going to have an informal program for this first meeting. In the spirit of the show-and-tell format, we'll have everybody talk for a couple of minutes about what experiments/tracking projects they are doing. Then there will be some time for discussion and questions, so that people can seek help or offer advice.</p> <p>At the end we are going to have a short presentation from Seth Roberts, emeritus professor of psychology at UC Berkeley. Roberts is a member of the QS meetup and an expert on self-experimentation. He'll share a few ideas about how to handle data-gathering and analysis in the search for new ideas and valid results.

He said that he noticed a lot of "write once/read never" approaches to self-tracking. Data collection - is it an end in itself? Or do you want to do something useful and interesting with your data? I propose this as the theme for our next meeting. So if you are are self-tracking, and are going to present your project, think in advance about what is meaningful about the data you are gathering.</p> <p>Seth Roberts, another long time QS attendee, sometimes pipes up with this question: "what did you learn?"</p> <p>We will take that as our provisional headline for this month's talks.</p>,{u'who': u'Self-Quantifiers', u'name': u'The Bay Area Quantified Self Meetup Group', u'group_lat': 37.75, u'created': 1217495495000, u'join_mode': u'open', u'group_lon': -122.41999816894531, u'urlname': u'quantifiedself', u'id': 1240980}

If you are self-tracking in any way - biometrics, mood monitoring, life-logging, DNA sequencing, etc. etc. - come and share your methods and results.</p> <p>We are making a few format changes this time. They are described below.</p> <p>Thanks to Peretz Partensky, we are meeting at <a href="http://blog.langtonlabs.org/">Langton Labs</a> in San Francisco. Langton Labs is "an institute for future living," with many interesting projects and events. Happily, Langton is just 2 blocks from the Civic Center BART, so it is easy to get to from anywhere in the Bay Area. I'll also start a carpool discussion if you want to post a ride request/offer.</p> <p>Responding to some intelligent feedback from the last few meetings, Kevin and I are going to make a few changes to the format this time. This is an experiment: your help, feedback, and analysis is welcome as always!</p> <p><b>6 -7 p.m. SELF-TRACKING WORKSHOP: Motion!</b></p> <p>The first hour of the Show&amp;Tell will be a casually-organized self-tracking workshop with a theme specified in advance. This weeks theme is Motion. Accelerometers, GPS transceivers, Geolocation apps, Exercise Challenges. If you are doing anything that involves tracking your physical movement, please bring something to share/demo/explain during the workshop portion of the Show&amp;Tell. You do not need to have a prepared talk. We will have tables and power strips where you can plug in a laptop, and we'll try to provide some helpful signage as well so that shy people who are standing at a distance can get a sense of what you have to show.</p> <p>Think: "poster session."</p> <p>You do not need permission to show something. Just come and bring what you have. However, I encourage you to email me in advance if you are bringing a project to share, so I know about how many people to expect. Also, if you have any particular equipment needs, let me know and I'll try to help. I hope this new format gives even more people a chance to show some of the interesting self-tracking they are doing.</p> <p>We are going to save the talks for personal accounts of self-tracking and self-experimentation, rather than sales/investor pitches. But of course we are also interested in tools.</p> <p><i>If you are making something useful for self-trackers – software, hardware, web services, or data standards – please demo it in the workshop portion of the Show&amp;Tell.</i></p> <p><b>7:00 - 7:30 p.m. – SOCIAL HALF HOUR</b></p> <p>The workshop will blend into our networking/social time.</p> <p><b>7:30 p.m. – QS SHOW&amp;TELL TALKS</b></p> <p>Since we are moving some of the content to the workshop portion of the Show&amp;Tell, we're going to experiment with having just 90 minutes of talks. We figure that's probably a reasonable amount of time to listen to other people talking. Kevin and I are going to moderate a bit more actively, and we are also going to be more flexible with the time allotted to each talk.</p> <p>Please let me know in advance if you plan to give a talk, so we can discuss how much time you'd like to take.<br/><b><br/>QS SPONSORSHIP</b></p> <p>The other change we are making is that we are going to look for financial sponsors for our Show&amp;Tell meetings. We will use the sponsor money to pay for professional video recording and some decent refreshments. Although some of our hosts have been very generous with food and drink, it seems only decent of us to pay our own way. And while Kevin has kindly created a homemade video record so that the talks aren't utterly lost to posterity, we both would like to see a higher level of documentation.</p> <p>If you or your company would be willing to sponsor a QS Show&amp;Tell, please let us know. Steve Dean, the organizer of the New York City QS Show&amp;Tell, is joining us in this sponsorship experiment. All money, by the way, will go to pay for QS Show&amp;Tell expenses. This is a volunteer effort, and the organizers do not profit from it.</p> <p>NAME TAGS</p> <p>We are going to printing name tags this time. MeetUp makes this easy, but it uses the names that you give on your profile.

Once again, there will be a workshop/science fair during the social hour. We are inviting people to show their products, tools, &amp; experiments in an informal "buffet style" context. We've asked some great people to participate, and we have high hopes.

August is usually a bit different here at QS anyway, as many of us are traveling. And this August we're pretty busy getting ready for the annual QS conference in Palo Alto. So after we had our fourth email from a speaker saying that travel plans made them prefer to delay their talk, we put our heads together and decided this was a chance to experiment that we couldn't resist. Especially since we are hosted at Singularity.</p> <p>Most our program this time is going to devoted to an informal seminar on QS &amp; Science, which has been a topic of much discussion among many of us over the last year. We're going to have very short (1-5 minute) intros by respected, long-time QS contributors, and then open discussion. At the end of the program, we'll return to our conventional program, with a talk by Ariel Berwaldt about the details of sleep tracking. And he'll show plenty of data, for anybody who is worried.</p> <p>Here are some of the participants and topics:</p> <p><a href="https://twitter.com/agaricus">Gary Wolf</a>: Moderator</p> <p><a href="http://curetogether.com/blog/about/team/">Daniel Reda</a>: Correlation</p> <p><a href="https://plus.google.com/104671528092959920288/posts">Yoni Donner</a>: Validity of tests &amp; assesments</p> <p><a href="http://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~thumper/">Bo Adler</a>: Measurement error</p> <p><a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/video/424427/stressed-chess/">Dave Marvit</a>: Normalizing data &amp; using common instruments</p> <p><a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/robert-evans/0/71/73a">Bob Evans</a>: Keeping records</p> <p><a href="http://quantifiedself.com/2012/07/nick-winter-a-lazy-mans-approach-to-cognitive-testing/">Nick Winter</a> and <a href="https://de.twitter.com/grapealope">Rachel Kalmar</a>: responses and comments</p> <p>8:30 - 10 pm MORE SOCIAL TIME</p> <p>Talk to the speakers, chat with new and old friends, ask other people what they're tracking, and generally hang out and have a great time.</p> <p> </p> <p>QS SPONSORS: OUR THANKS TO <a href="http://www.singularityu.org">Singularity University</a>!</p> <p>A fantastic space is generously being provided by our friends at Singularity U! Thanks too to <a href="http://intel.com/">Intel</a>, <a href="http://autodesk.com/">Autodesk</a>, and <a href="http://www.scanadu.com/">Scanadu</a>, our annual sponsors, for supporting the Quantified Self movement across the country and around the world.

quantifiedself,1384361389000,46,Story Swap,http://www.meetup.com/quantifiedself/events/150703652/,<p>We’re doing something new and fun this time around for our Bay Area QS Meetup: a two part meetup in conjunction with some friends and colleagues who have a keen interest in data visualization: the Bay Area D3 Users Group. On November 21st we’re gathering these two wonderful communities together to listen, learn, and plan together. The goal of the first meetup is to foster  collaborations between the data visualization experts from D3 and QS members who are looking to have their data visualized in new and interesting ways. (We’re calling this a  “Story Swap.”) Then in mid-December we’ll all get together again and listen to the show&amp;tell talks that come out of the connections that formed at the Story Swap.</p> <p>Please join us! More details below.</p> <p><br/><b>What is a Story Swap?</b></p> <p>Think of the Story Swap as a kind of “mixer” for people who have a variety of skills and questions. Bring your skills, bring your questions. Use your skills to answer others’ questions, and get answers to your questions from people who have skills you lack.</p> <p>We’re inviting our QS meetup members to come with some personal data. Whether this data is neatly organized in a spreadsheet, or chicken scratches on paper, bring some of it along. We’ll have tags so that you can identify what type of data you’re tracking or interested in and we’ll be breaking into groups to discuss questions, ideas, and of course, visualizations!</p> <p>We know that starting these conversations can be difficult so we’ve devised a “icebreaker” of sorts to help conversations get going. When you RSVP, you’ll be asked if you can share a single personal data visualization that has been useful to you. Nothing fancy is necessary. A screen grab from a mobile app is fineas long as you’ve learned something from it. We’ll be turning these into name badges for the meetup and encouraging everyone to explore them together. If you’re attending and would like us to make you a visualization badge please <a href="http://quantifiedself.com/gallery-entry/">send us your visualization and a short description</a> by 11/20.</p> <p>(Don’t worry if you don’t have a personal data visualization to share, you are still welcome and invited!)</p> <p><b>What is D3?</b></p> <p><a href="http://d3js.org/">D3</a> is a programming library that has been used to power some of the web’s most interesting and explanatory data-driven visualizations. You can see D3 at work all over the web, from personal websites to the New York Times. We are collaborating with the D3 Users Group with the hope that we can work together to bring new visual and analytical perspectives to our QS data.</p> <p><b>Schedule:</b></p> <p><b>6:30 - 7:00 PM - Social Time &amp; Food</b></p> <p>We'll be providing light refreshments and beverages for everyone.

We'll also introduce about our work with personal QS data visualizations.</p> <p>Ian Johnson (D2 User Group) will give a brief background on the D3 User Group and provide a few examples of D3 being used for interesting data visualizations.</p> <p><b>7:15 - 8:30 PM - Story Swap</b></p> <p>We'll be breaking into small groups based on tracking topics (e.g. mood, physical activity, productivity, etc.).

Keeping with the recent "data" theme, we're gonna change it up a little and go visit our friends at Tableau (they love to visualize data). We're starting at 6pm at their <a href="http://www.tableausoftware.com/sites/default/files/pages/lake_view_building_visitor_info__0.pdf">Fremont location</a> and we'll have a general meet-and-greet until 6:30pm. Then we'll introduce QS for the first-timers among us, followed by any community announcements y'all may have. Afterwards, we'll give the Tableau team a little bit of time to talk to us about their projects and how they may benefit QS-ers. Then we'll get to the show-and-tell stories of your data (let us know if you want to present: what did you do, how did you do it, and what did you learn).

Hear from Chris Stolte, Tableau’s Chief Development Officer and Co-Founder, as he demos and speaks about Tableau’s product and plans. After Chris’s tech talk, meet with our team or mix and mingle with others in the local tech community.<br/>Chris Stolte runs all product design, product strategy, and engineering for Tableau Software. Chris’s early career as a database programmer helped him see the problems with existing analytical tools. “I remember writing programs that helped people get data directly in just a few minutes, where they used to wait a few weeks. I was astounded by their responses – they were shocked at being able to get the data so quickly and grateful they could do it themselves. I’ve never forgotten that.” Prior to Tableau, he was a co-founder and vice president of Beeline Systems, a digital mapping startup that was acquired by Vicinity (which was in turn acquired by Microsoft). Chris is a co-inventor on five software patents related to information visualization and has published 12 research papers on information visualization.</p>,{u'who': u'Quantifiers', u'name': u'Seattle Quantified Self Meetup Group', u'group_lat': 47.630001068115234, u'created': 1273107049000, u'join_mode': u'open', u'group_lon': -122.29000091552734, u'urlname': u'Quantified-Self-Seattle', u'id': 1641339}

PDX-Quantified-Self,1377559997000,30,Quantified Self Show & Tell,http://www.meetup.com/PDX-Quantified-Self/events/136825772/,<p>*UPDATE - Here is a list of tomorrow's talks as well as a revised schedule. The original announcement is below*</p> <p><br/><b>Dawn Nafus</b> - An anthropologist who studies Quantified Self, Dawn will talk about her own adventure in self-tracking: trying to come up with a meaningful and sustainable method of tracking her food choices.</p> <p><b>Aaron Parecki</b> - Aaron will be discussing his challenges with finding self-tracking tools that make it easy to collect data with minimum effort on his part. This is a preview of the talk that Aaron will give at the QS Global Conference in San Francisco in October.</p> <p><b>Rob Shields</b> - Rob will give us an update on his lifelogging project where he wears a camera that takes a picture every minute (from last October’s meetup). With another year’s worth of data, he’ll talk about what he’s learned since.</p> <p><b>Danny Reeves and Bethany Soule</b> - Danny &amp; Bethany are the founders of BeeMinder, a service that helps users keep commitment contracts with themselves. They will talk about how they use data to not only observe oneself, but to “program” oneself. This too is a preview of a talk that will be given at the QS Global Conference.</p> <p><b>Sterling Hooten</b> - Sterling will be talking about using Google Calendar as a tool to track his time and what he’s learned about his behaviors. </p> <p><b>Kent Bye </b>- A talk that Kent says may be controversial, he will speak about his tool, “Natal Transits”, that helps him navigate the exceedingly complicated world of astrology.</p> <p><b>Post-Meetup Drinks!</b> - We’ve determined that after the meetup, we will keep the conversation going at BridgePort Brewpub which is only two blocks away from Puppet Labs at 1313 NW Marshall St</p> <p>Also, because of the number of speakers, we probably won’t have time for walk-ons or the Group Mind format. Here is the revised schedule: <br/>• 6 to 6:30 pm: <b>Mingling</b>. Snacks and refreshments will be provided. <br/>• 6:30 to 6:45 pm: <b>Introduction</b> <br/>• 7 pm to 8:30 pm: <b>Show &amp; Tell talks</b><br/>• 8:30 pm onward:<b> Continued discussion</b> at BridgePort Brewpub.</p> <p>See you there.</p> <p>-Steven</p> <p>


*Original Posting*</p> <p><br/>Tracking your mood with your smartphone? Recording your workouts, diet and/or weight? Using a Fitbit, Withings scale, or heart-rate monitor? </p> <p><br/>Quantified Self is "<b>self-knowledge through numbers</b>" and we want to hear your self-tracking stories! <b>Sign up to give a talk</b>. Our content comes from our community. Show us your graphs, spreadsheets, biometric devices, practical solutions and crazy notions. They are all welcome. We focus on real self-tracking projects involving your <b>personal data</b>.</p> <p>Or just bring your enthusiasm and come to marvel and learn with us. <b>Sharing is not required</b> if you're just curious to see what this is about! </p> <p>

<b>Agenda</b>:</p> <p>• 6 to 6:30 pm: Doors open. <b>Social time</b>. This is an opportunity to meet other self-trackers and catch up with friends.</p> <p>• 6:30 to 7 pm: <b>Group Mind</b>. Do you have a tool that you’re working on, or a self-tracking idea that you want feedback on? The format for Group Mind is 2.5 minutes to talk about your question, project, issue, proposal or challenge and 2.5 minutes to solicit ideas and brainstorming from our members. It is a great way to kick-start or problem-solve your QS issue. You’ll be able to sign up to participate on the day of the event.</p> <p>• 7 to 8 pm: <b>Scheduled Show &amp; Tell talks</b>. These are 7 minute talks with 5 minutes for questions. This is the meat &amp; potatoes of QS meetups. This is an opportunity to share your story with your peers. Please contact us in advance if you want to give one.</p> <p>• 8 to 8:30 pm: <b>Walk-on Show &amp; Tell talks</b>. These are 5 minutes with time for a couple questions. They are signed up for on the day of the event, using a sheet at the welcome table. We’ll go through as many as we can, time permitting.</p> <p>• 8:30 pm onward: The discussion continues over drinks at a pub to-be-named later! This is a good opportunity to talk with presenters or follow-up on an issue that came up in the Group Mind. If you can join us, I very much encourage you to do so. Not only is it good fun, but the conversations are invigorating.</p> <p>If you're interested in doing a Show &amp; Tell, <b>please mention it in your RSVP or email the organizers in advance</b>. If we hear from you before the meetup, you’ll have a little more time and be guaranteed to talk. You can also sign up on the day of the event as a walk-on.</p> <p>A note <b>if you plan on presenting</b>: don’t think that this needs to be a TED Talk. We call it Show &amp; Tell for a reason. This is just like first grade. All you have to do is come up, show us something and tell us about it. You can use slides if you want, but it is not required.</p> <p>One thing that will help with your talk is to structure it around these three questions: <b>What did you do? How did you do it? What did you learn?</b>  Remember, sharing is important and valuable even if you share your failures - you never know when someone else will be trying the same thing and you can help them avoid the mistakes that you made!  We want to hear your personal stories, and that means really human things like struggling with motivation, experiencing setbacks, and hopefully, every so often, having a flash of insight! Keep it <b>informal</b>. Keep it <b>honest</b>. You're in a safe place. </p> <p>It helps to watch videos of <a href="http://vimeo.com/groups/quantifiedself/videos">previous QS talks</a>. This <a href="http://quantifiedself.com/2011/09/our-three-prime-questions/">link</a> explains why these three questions make for a good talk.</p> <p>Finally, thanks to our friends at <a href="http://puppetlabs.com/">PuppetLabs</a> for providing the space. And feel free to tweet at the event - #QuantifiedSelf #QSPDX</p> <p>We can't wait to see you there!</p> <p>-Steven, Rob, Mark, Ioan</p>,{u'who': u'Self Trackers in PDX', u'name': u'PDX Quantified Self', u'group_lat': 45.52000045776367, u'created': 1308175889000, u'join_mode': u'open', u'group_lon': -122.63999938964844, u'urlname': u'PDX-Quantified-Self', u'id': 2028061}

It doesn't a formal presentation, and can be as much as 10 minutes or as short as you like.

PDX-Quantified-Self,1409935939000,20,Show&Tell,http://www.meetup.com/PDX-Quantified-Self/events/205399332/,<p>***Note about the space: The doors close at 7pm, so don't be late in arriving! But if you are, we'll provide a number for you to call[masked]***</p> <p>Tracking your mood with your smartphone? Recording your workouts, diet and/or weight? Using a Fitbit, Withings scale, or heart-rate monitor?</p> <p>Quantified Self is "self-knowledge through numbers" and we want to hear your self-tracking stories! Sign up to give a talk. Our content comes from our community. Show us your graphs, spreadsheets, biometric devices, practical solutions and crazy notions. They are all welcome. We focus on real self-tracking projects involving your personal data.</p> <p>Or just bring your enthusiasm and come to marvel and learn with us. Sharing is not required if you're just curious to see what this is about! Agenda:</p> <p>• 6 to 6:30 pm: Doors open. Social time. This is an opportunity to meet other self-trackers and catch up with friends.</p> <p>• 6:30 pm: Intro to QS plus news. We'll provide a brief intro about QS, as well as, what's been happening in the past months in the news on how people are finding meaning from their personal data.</p> <p>• 6:45 to 7:15 pm: Scheduled Show&amp;Tell talks. These are 7 minute talks with 5 minutes for questions. This is the meat &amp; potatoes of QS meetups. This is an opportunity to share your story with your peers. Please contact us in advance if you want to give one. We'll send out a list of speakers in advance of the meet up.</p> <p>• 7:15 to 7:45 pm: Walk-on Show&amp;Tell talks. These are 5 minutes with time for a couple questions. They are signed up for on the day of the event, using a sheet at the welcome table. We’ll go through as many as we can, time permitting.</p> <p>• 7:45 to 8:30 pm: We'll open things up for general discussion if there's anything that someone wants to bring up to the group. Then we'll break and hang out for awhile. This is a good opportunity to talk with presenters If you're interested in doing a Show&amp;Tell, please mention it in your RSVP or email the organizers in advance. You can also sign up on the day of the event as a walk-on.</p> <p>A note if you plan on presenting: don’t think that this needs to be a TED Talk. We call it Show&amp;Tell for a reason. This is just like first grade. All you have to do is come up, show us something and tell us about it. You can use slides if you want, but it is not required. Even if you didn't find anything that you think is amazing. We want to hear about what you tried and what you found out.</p> <p>One thing that will help with your Show&amp;Tell is to structure it around these three questions: What did you do? How did you do it? What did you learn? Remember, sharing is important and valuable even if you share your failures - you never know when someone else will be trying the same thing and you can help them avoid the mistakes that you made! We want to hear your personal stories, and that means really human things like struggling with motivation, experiencing setbacks, and hopefully, every so often, having a flash of insight! Keep it informal. Keep it honest. You're in a safe place. Finally, thanks to our friends at Mozilla for providing the space. And feel free to tweet at the event - #QuantifiedSelf #QSPDX</p> <p>We can't wait to see you there!</p> <p>-Steven, Rob, Mark, Ioan</p>,{u'who': u'Self Trackers in PDX', u'name': u'PDX Quantified Self', u'group_lat': 45.52000045776367, u'created': 1308175889000, u'join_mode': u'open', u'group_lon': -122.63999938964844, u'urlname': u'PDX-Quantified-Self', u'id': 2028061}
