Forget-Me-Not: A “Biography-Generating Device”
The Forget-Me-Not was a life-logging device created before web development and smartphones came along.

===========

The original  UP allowed users to track their sleep, eating habits, and daily steps. Additionally, it features a vibration motor that can serve as an alarm to wake users at the “best” phase of their sleep cycle, or prompt users when they have been sedentary for too long.


UP allows users to track their sleep, eating habits, and daily activity including steps taken and calories burned. The wristband is water-resistant and designed to be worn 24/7, with a rechargeable battery that lasts for up to 10 days at a time.[10] The wristband also features a vibration motor that can be programmed as an alarm to wake users in the best phase of their natural sleep cycle, or act as a reminder when users have been sedentary too long

STEVE MANN PUBLISHES THAT PAPER

In his paper, then-MIT Media Lab researcher Steve Mann describes his vision for wearable computing. He also discusses his experiences with his prototype wearable computer:


“…people were… taken aback by the combination of a human wearing a computer—-there was something markedly different in the way others perceived a system attached to my body rather than carried in a briefcase. When I did wear it, I basked in a tremendous sense of self-empowerment, for it seemed the computer was more part of me than it was a separate tool.”
